# Pizza Menu React App

Welcome to my Pizza Menu React App! üçï This is my first React project, created as part of the Jonas React Course to learn the basics of React.

## Overview

This app is a simple Pizza Menu built to practice React concepts like components, conditional rendering, props, destructuring of props, JSX, and setting classes and text conditionally.

## Features
